The [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KsZgm4PFch6b3rUbjFqhxy9_IVJKshx5?usp=sharing) contains:

* the original novels (not needed to run the code but useful)
* readability data used in the R code including the LIWC and Stanford Tagger outputs and rankings (required to run the code)

The various tests are in the main GitHub folders
